Before you use it, you should be familiar with perceptual      colors <u>or not</u> because you just have to look at them for appreciate      them. You should notice that the perceptual color system use in      PerceptualColorPicker is CIE Lab and its polar coordinates&nbsp;      transformation CIE LcH. Unlike other color picker, PerceptualColorPicker      use graphic tools to choose between 3 and 7 colors instead of only one.</div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;"><br>    </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: right;">Your are      maybe impatient to use it and, in the same time, curious about how it      works. Let's begin to explain it !</div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: left;"><br>    </div>    <div style="text-align: center; margin: auto; width: 620px;">      <h3>The planes menu</h3>      <img src="menuPlan.png" alt="menuPlan" title="menuPlan"></div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;"><br>    </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;">You may      have already notice that colors are generally describe with tree numbers      as they are tri-dimensionnal data. Unfortunately screen have only two      dimensions. So we can only have two coordinates displayed on screen. We      use a slider to go through the third one. Using CIE Lab and CIE Lch there      are six planes which are those listed by the planes menu. </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;">The      first one is a/b which means that we have the "a" coordinate of CIE Lab      for the X-axis and&nbsp; "b" coordinate for the Y-axis. You could see it      on the general view of the interface above. You could also see the "L" at      the right of the "ortho" slider which means that the slider will go      through the "L" values (0-100) of the CIE Lab. It works the same way for      the five others planes : the first letter to X-axis, the second letter to      the Y-axis and the letter what is not in the menu is the variable that the      slider goes through.</div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;"><br>    </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: center;">      <h3>The modes menu</h3>      <img src="menuMode.png" alt="menuMode" title="menuMode">      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">There are two modes : ortho and contraste.        Their names are not self explanatory. To understand what they mean it's        necessary to remember that the goal of a color picker is to go through        the whole set of colors which is a volume. When we have&nbsp; a plane        there are different ways to go through the volume with it. In        PerceptiveColorPicker we use two ways :</div>      <div style="text-align: left;">- ortho : the first way is to go through        the volume keeping the plane parallel to the axes. As we said that the        fist coordinate was affected to the the X-axis and the second to the        Y-axis, we could say that the third coordinate is affected to the Z-axis        and is constant over the plane. Its constant value is given by the ortho        slider.</div>      <div style="text-align: left;">- contraste : another way for going trough        the colors volume is to use a gradient instead a constant for the third        coordinate. In this case the slider goes from 0° to 360° to change the        orientation of the gradient attempting that the vector gradient always        goes through the origin of the orthonormal. Don't beware if you don't        understand the way it works, just look at the colors to choose them.        That's what is really useful !!! The ring with the value gradient which        turns when the slider moves is a hint of what is happening with the        colors plane. When L is the variable you should find a relation of the        lowest color values of the plane and the dark side of the ring.</div>      <div style="text-align: left;">        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The tools menu</h3>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>      <img src="menuOutils.png" alt="menuOutils" title="menuOutils"></div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;"><br>    </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;">This      menu provide intuitive tools. The tools look at the color what are below      each circle they have. If a circle is out of the colors plane the tool see      the background color below the circle. Because of the colors planes      variations, the user must take care the tool he uses stays over them. The      + and -, on the left, vary the number of divisions, from 3&nbsp; to 7, for      segment and quadratic and the number of sides for polygon. </div>    <div style="margin: auto; width: 620px; text-align: justify;">      <ul>        <li>segment : segment is useful for linear gradient in different planes.          If you are using them for neutral representation of data beware of the          chroma variations however. (chroma = c from Hcl).</li>        <li>quadratic : a quadratic curve is a spline with only one control          point. It's a more dynamic tool that provide nice effects.</li>        <li>polygon : in the a/b plane polygons give the most balanced theme. If          it stays centered on the plane origin you'll see that the chroma is          constant. The center button is available for polygons if you need to          center them again.</li>        <li>related : two colors have two related colors because in a plane you          can construct two related points when you swap their coordinates.          These four colors have very strong relations. I love them !</li>        <li>palette : palette is a more complex tool. You place the three vertex          of a triangle and it give the average color of each side and also of          the three vertex. If you keep the center in the translation ring you          get more balanced theme. Palette give seven colors but you can avoid          the fourth that is the center.&nbsp; The center button is available          for palettes if you need to center them again.</li>      </ul>      <h3 style="  text-align: center;">The color code menu</h3>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="menuColorCode.png"          alt="menuColorCode"          title="menuColorCode"></div>      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">Changing the color code have two functions        :</div>      <div style="text-align: left;">        <ul>          <li>the more obvious is to permit to export color theme out of            PerceptualColorPicker. WEB and sRGB are for that use.</li>          <li>another function is to control perceptual characteristics of color            theme by looking at the variations when using the sliders of the two            modes. For that you'll use CIE Lab and CIE LcH.</li>        </ul>      </div>      <h3 style="  text-align: center;">The snapshot menu</h3>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="menuSnapshot.png"          alt="menu snapshot"          title="menu snapshot"></div>      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">The small snapshot export the colors as a        png file :</div>      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="smallSnapshot.png"          alt="small"          title="small"></div>      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">The wide snapshot export the whole window.        That allows you to keep memory of how you got your theme and its        characteristics.</div>      <p><br>      </p>      <h3 style="  text-align: center;">Other commands</h3>      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="menuBas.png"          alt="bas"          title="bas"></div>      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">Copy : copy to the clipboard the web colors        code.</div>      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>      </div>      <div style="text-align: left;">Light gray square button : change the        background of the PerceptualColorPicker.
